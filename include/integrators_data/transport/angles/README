Files with angular quadrature formulas.

The formulas are generated with Jean Ragua's and Richard Sanchez' code.

TODO: Documentation on parameters for the formulas.

The file structure is as follows:

1. (int d) space dimension of the formula
2. (int n) number of quadrature points
3. (int m) number of moments (the other dimension of the matrices M
   and D)
4. (double^d double) For each quadrature point the coordinates and the
   quadrature weight
5. (double^(n times m)) The matrix M
6. (double^(m times n)) The matrix D

The file names are DdPnKm.angles, where d, n, and m are the numbers in
items 1 to 3 above.
